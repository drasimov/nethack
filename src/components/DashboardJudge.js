            <p className="serifBold">The Hackathon submissions for 2025R1 can be found below. Some notes on judging:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Code, Video, and Project Information (title, description) should be mandatory.</li>
                <li>Github and Technologies list was explicitly stated to be optional. </li>
                <li>Submissions are uniquely identified by teamID.</li>
            </ul><br/>
            <p className="serifBold">Some additional notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Since these submissions will eventually be displayed on this site, it is better for submissions to have proper titles and technologies lists</li>
                <li>A very basic tool is given on the upper-right corner for you to edit these as needed. This will directly change the entries in our Hackathon database</li>
                <li>Links are included for your convenience. However, some may be broken/locked behind login; you may need to go back to the Teams assignment page to see the submission</li>
                <li>Additional judging features should be available for future rounds (e.g. Add Comment). For now we suggest you keep organized in external documents :(</li>
